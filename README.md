# 🧪 Study Flutter

This repository is dedicated to my daily Flutter and Dart training.

Here, I experiment with:
- 🔁 Dart algorithm practice (loops, lists, maps, conditions)
- 🧱 Manual Flutter widget writing (like Navigator, BlocBuilder, TextField...)
- 🧩 UI rendering and navigation exercises
- 🧠 Logical thinking and real app feature simulations
